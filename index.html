        <span>In February 1926, Hans Wilsdorf  had the trademark “The Tudor” registered and started making watches bearing that signature on the dial. Just after the Second World War, Hans Wilsdorf knew that the time had come to expand and give the brand a proper identity of its own. On 6 March 1946, he created “Montres TUDOR S.A.”, specialising in models for both men and women. Rolex would guarantee the technical, aesthetic and functional characteristics, along with the distribution and after-sales service.</span>

                <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For some years now, I have been considering the idea of making a watch that our agents could sell at a more modest price than our Rolex watches, and yet one that would attain the standard of dependability for which Rolex is famous. I decided to form a separate company, with the object of making and marketing this new watch. <br>It is called the TUDOR watch company."</span>

                <span>As a child, David Beckham had a dream. Whenever asked about what he would want to be later in life he invariably answered “a football player”. This early drive led him to become one of the most acclaimed, loved and successful players in the history of the game. With three major clubs and 115 selections in the English football team, 59 as captain, he left his mark: 6 England Championship titles, 2 Major League Soccer cups, one time Champion of Spain and one time UEFA Champion. Beckham wears the TUDOR Royal, the epitome of versatile sport-chic with its integrated bracelet, notched bezel and automatic movement.</span>
